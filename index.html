    <p> hiii my name is erika and this my travel diary/blog :D
        in the past couple of years, i have traveled to several
        states and countries. i always like to reminsice at my
        pictures and experience so i thought why not create a
        blog especially while i'm learning how to code. i have
        gained so many new connections, perspectives, and experiences 
        from traveling so im here to share my experience from each 
        country/state. enjoy!! :)))
