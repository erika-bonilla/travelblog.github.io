    Houston, my home. I moved here in 2018 from Long Island, New York, and am so thankful for this place. I visited Texas for the first time at the beginning of 2018 and once more in May of the same year. 
    Then, in July, my family decided to move down to Houston. I've been here for 7 years now and I have made so many connections, experienced core memories, and eaten the best food in the country in my opinion. 
    My relationship with Houston is toxic if I am being honest haha. I cannot stand the infrastructure, driving 30 mins to an our to get anywhere, the politics, the healthcare, the highways, and the mega churches. 
    In texas, you don't come out as gay, you come out as an agnostic/atheist. Although I may complain about Houston all time, I hold so much love for this place. The community is PRESENT! I remember coming from 
    Long Island, everyone would just naturally segregate themselves. I remember at lunch, we used to have different tables separated by race. When I went to my first day of school in Texas, the first thing I noticed
    was the diversity, the friend groups were diverse! I remember finally feeling like I belonged/welcomed idk and that is what keeps me here. I have made so many friends down here and I don't even want to think
    about the day that we all go our own way. The arts community is actually pretty vibrant down here, it's just lowkey. Obviously, nothing like NYC, but don't underestimate htown. Overall, I love this place and I plan
    on retiring here.
